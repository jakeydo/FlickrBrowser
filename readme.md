# Flickr Browser

This is a simple iOS app to browse interesting photos on flickr. It will currently show you some of the top interesting photos from flickr in a semi-random order.

## Setup

Before using the app, you will need a [flickr API key](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/). Open the XCode project, add your API key to "Flickr Browser-Prefix.pch" in the spot for FLBRflickrAPIKey. You should then be able to build and run the project.
